# Product Base

Product-ready Nx workspace bundling a Node backend, an Expo mobile client, and shared TypeScript libraries.

## Workspace Map

- `apps/backend` – Express-based API starter
- `apps/mobile` – Expo / React Native starter
- `libs/backend` – backend domain models and errors
- `libs/shared` – env helpers, response types, utilities

## Getting Started

```sh
nvm use                 # or install the Node version in .nvmrc
npm install
npx nx graph            # optional: visualize project relationships
npx nx serve backend      # run the API
npx nx start mobile    # open the mobile app with Expo
```

## Common Commands

- `npx nx build backend` – production backend build
- `npx nx lint mobile` – lint the mobile app
- `npx nx test backend` – run backend library tests
- `npx nx show project <name>` – inspect any project’s targets

## Repo Layout

```text
apps/       deployable services & clients
libs/       shared code (models, utils, env)
migrations/ SQL migrations managed with Drizzle
tools/      workspace automation scripts
```

Use `npx nx list` to discover installed plugins and `npx nx g <generator>` to scaffold new features as the workspace grows.

## Add new projects

While you could add new projects to your workspace manually, you might want to leverage [Nx plugins](https://nx.dev/concepts/nx-plugins?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) and their [code generation](https://nx.dev/features/generate-code?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) feature.

Use the plugin's generator to create new projects.

To generate a new application, use:

```sh
npx nx g @nx/node:app demo
```

To generate a new library, use:

```sh
npx nx g @nx/node:lib mylib
```

You can use `npx nx list` to get a list of installed plugins. Then, run `npx nx list <plugin-name>` to learn about more specific capabilities of a particular plugin. Alternatively, [install Nx Console](https://nx.dev/getting-started/editor-setup?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) to browse plugins and generators in your IDE.
